# Cellular Automata

Open-source implementation of a cellular automata scheme, using implementation partially derived from articles on the internet (too many to credit!). Use as desired (note LICENSE.txt).

This is completely compatible with Unity, and in fact was designed with it in mind. If you do not want to use this with Unity, comment out the `#define UNITY` on the first line.
